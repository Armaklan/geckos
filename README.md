Geckos Edit Cards ... kos ... ?

 We don't know why Geckos edit cards, but this tool is aimed to create your own template and cards for gaming. Kinda like the Magic Set Editor, but full web.

[Do you want to test the latest version of Geckos ?](http://gulix.github.io/geckos)

## The Why

I'm a player. Roleplaying, boardgames, miniatures. And I've found that having cards to store information is great around the table. The spells of my D&D bard, the profiles of my Pulp City heroes, my Pulp Alley league, ...

I've been using Magic Set Editor to create my cards. But some dead-ends keep coming. So, beginning to play with web development, I started to thought of a way to make my own 'Magic Set Editor', to edit my cards. And here's what I've come to.

## The What

**Geckos** is a web application, built with the javascript technology. No server-side code, so that it's easy to deploy and not related to some server configuration. The goal is to get a web page that anyone can use, loading his own template, and editing his cards. With those templates being shared.

It's free, open-source, and you can get it, modify it, enhance it. Feel free to propose upgrades. Geckos is on github for this reason.

**Geckos** will not work without those libraries, that I use inside the project :

* knockoutJS
* FabricJS
* FileSaver.js

## The How

With the first Alpha release, **Geckos** will have its own page. You can have a taste of it by downloading the source code and launch the index.html page. Still in progress.

The [wiki](https://github.com/Gulix/geckos/wiki) will provide guide to how create a template, to use it to make cards, and how in general **Geckos** is working. Something is missing ? Feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/Gulix/geckos/issues) to ask for an explanation.

## The Who

I'm Nicolas, a French gamer (that can explain some bad english) and developer, I like fun games, not so the heavy ones. I also like sports, craft beer (that software is a [BeerWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware)), comics and many other things.
