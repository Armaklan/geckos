Geckos Edit Cards ... kos ... ?

We don't know why Geckos edit cards, but this tool is aimed to create your own template and cards for gaming. Kinda like the Magic Set Editor, but full web.

## The why

I'm a player. Roleplaying, boardgames, miniatures. And I've found that having cards to store information is great around the table. The spells of my D&D bard, the profiles of my Pulp City heroes, my Pulp Alley league, ...

I've been using Magic Set Editor to create my cards. But some dead-ends keep coming.
